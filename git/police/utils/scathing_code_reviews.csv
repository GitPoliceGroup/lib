Review
"I’ve reviewed your code, and I’m convinced you learned programming from a cursed scroll."
This isn’t a codebase; it’s a monument to chaos in digital form.
Your logic is like a choose-your-own-adventure book where every path leads to disappointment.
"I’d call your code spaghetti, but even spaghetti has some structure. This is more like lasagna that’s been thrown at a wall."
"Whatever you were trying to achieve, you missed by a margin so wide it could house an airport."
Your code doesn’t just reinvent the wheel; it reinvents it as a square.
"I ran your code and got a runtime error, but honestly, I think it’s my computer rejecting your logic out of self-respect."
Reading this made me question if you’ve ever used a keyboard before.
"Somewhere in here, there’s a good idea struggling to escape, but your syntax is holding it hostage."
Your code is a perfect example of why future civilizations will fear us.
"I tried to debug this, but it turns out your code debugs me."
This isn’t just bad—it’s revolutionary in its wrongness.
"The only optimization your code needs is CTRL+A, DELETE."
Every line of this code radiates pain. Pain for me. Pain for the compiler. Pain for the entire team.
Your naming conventions are so bad they qualify as cryptography.
I didn’t know it was possible to write code that both looks and performs like a practical joke.
This isn’t technical debt; this is an overdue loan with interest rates from a loan shark.
Your error handling strategy is essentially ‘let it crash and hope for the best.’
"I would say this code is inefficient, but that would imply it does anything at all."
"This code is the programming equivalent of a dumpster fire, but less organized."

"I’ve reviewed your code, and I’m convinced you learned programming from a cursed scroll."

Your logic is like a choose-your-own-adventure book where every path leads to disappointment.
"I’d call your code spaghetti, but even spaghetti has some structure. This is more like lasagna that’s been thrown at a wall."

Your code doesn’t just reinvent the wheel; it reinvents it as a square.
"I ran your code and got a runtime error, but honestly, I think it’s my computer rejecting your logic out of self-respect."
Reading this made me question if you’ve ever used a keyboard before.
"Somewhere in here, there’s a good idea struggling to escape, but your syntax is holding it hostage."
Your code is a perfect example of why future civilizations will fear us.

"I tried to debug this, but it turns out your code debugs me."
This isn’t just bad—it’s revolutionary in its wrongness.
"The only optimization your code needs is CTRL+A, DELETE."
Every line of this code radiates pain. Pain for me. Pain for the compiler. Pain for the entire team.
Your naming conventions are so bad they qualify as cryptography.
I didn’t know it was possible to write code that both looks and performs like a practical joke.
This isn’t technical debt; this is an overdue loan with interest rates from a loan shark.
Your error handling strategy is essentially ‘let it crash and hope for the best.’
"I would say this code is inefficient, but that would imply it does anything at all."
"This code is the programming equivalent of a dumpster fire, but less organized."
"I’ve reviewed your code, and I’m convinced you learned programming from a cursed scroll."
This isn’t a codebase; it’s a monument to chaos in digital form.
Your logic is like a choose-your-own-adventure book where every path leads to disappointment.
"I’d call your code spaghetti, but even spaghetti has some structure. This is more like lasagna that’s been thrown at a wall."
"Whatever you were trying to achieve, you missed by a margin so wide it could house an airport."
Your code doesn’t just reinvent the wheel; it reinvents it as a square.
"I ran your code and got a runtime error, but honestly, I think it’s my computer rejecting your logic out of self-respect."
Reading this made me question if you’ve ever used a keyboard before.
